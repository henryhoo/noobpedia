## Philosophy

- Our goal is to have a `community based` knowledge sharing platform.
- Please share if you find something sweet --- As a contributor we encourage you to discuss existing resources and contribute new resource if you think they are `most relevant and up-tp-date`.
- People have different learning styles --- Therefore we group each learning resource by type (video, reading, online course etc) and tag they with length. So that user can select resources most suitable to their own learning styles.
- Your votes matter --- Every user have the right to `vote` for your favourite resource. We will use votes to rank the resources for each topic!
- We welcome developers and new ideas --- If you have ideas to improve the platform please [raise a GitHub issue.](https://github.com/noobpedia/noobpedia/issues)
